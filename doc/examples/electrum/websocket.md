# Electrum websocket

In the [websocket.html](websocket.html) file you can find an example of a very simplistic client, which talks to the electrum module of a local server. This example assumes a rivine deamon is running localy, with the electrum module enabled, and the electrum modules websocket server listening on port 7002. The example demonstrates pinging the server, using the version negotiation, and subscribing to an address for the status. The address in the example is the address which has the devnet blockstakes. If your local deamon is running the devnet, has a wallet with this genesis seed loaded, and a blockcreator module, unlocking the wallet will cause blocks to get created, which will in turn cause regular updates to be send about the address status (every time a new block is created). 

It should be noted that this example only demonstrates talking to the server. For instance, there is no checking of the response (which needs to be done based on the ID set in the request), and the connection will close after 10 minutes. To avoid that, there should be a function sending a ping request to the server every so often. Since the timeout of the request is about 10 minutes, a good ping interval would be slightly less (to account for latency).
